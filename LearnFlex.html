                    The desert rain frog is a small, plump species with bulging eyes, a short snout, short limbs, spade-like feet, and webbed toes. On the underside, it has a transparent area of skin through which its internal organs can be seen. It can be between 4 to 6 centimetres (1.6 to 2.4 in) long. Its color is yellowish-brown, and sand often adheres to its skin.

                     Its natural habitat is the narrow strip of sandy shores between the sea and the sand dunes.

                    Desert Rain Frogs lives along the western coast of South Africa and Namibia in a region known as Namaqualand, an arid coastal desert in the Succulent Karoo ecoregion with large sand dunes and sparse desert vegetation (Van Jaarsveld 1987).

                    The desert rain frog is nocturnal, spending the day in a burrow which is dug to a depth of 10 to 20 centimetres (3.9 to 7.9 in) where the sand is moist. It emerges on both foggy and clear nights and wanders about over the surface of the dunes. Its footprints are distinctive and are often found around patches of dung where it is presumed to feed on moths, beetles, and insect larvae. It digs its way into the sand in the morning and its presence in a locality can be deduced from the little pile of loose sand dislodged by its burrowing activities.[5] Breeding is by direct development of eggs laid in its burrow, and there is no aqueous tadpole stage. It produces a high-pitched squeaking sound when threatened.

                    It also has an unusually high-pitched cry similar to that of a squeaky toy
